# DuckDuckGo

## 1 Explain how Google tracks you and we don't.
Search secrets should remain private and away from the targeting of advertisers.

## 2 DuckDuckGo apps block Google's hidden trackers.
Google trackers lurk on 75% of the top million websites. No thanks.

## 3 Get unbiased results outside the Filter Bubble.
We're committed to unbiased search that's never based on your search history.

## 4 Stand up for a pro-privacy business model.
The world needs an alternative to the collect-it-all business model.
